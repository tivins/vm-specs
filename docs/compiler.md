# NL Compiler — Semantic Analyses and Compile-Time Guarantees

This document describes the **semantic analyses** and **compile-time checks** that the NL compiler must perform. It
complements [specs.md](specs.md) (language semantics) and [stdlib.md](stdlib.md) (standard library). The spec defines
*what* the language allows; this document defines *what the compiler must verify and reject*.

## Definite assignment analysis

The compiler tracks the initialization state of every variable and property across all control-flow paths. A variable
is *definitely assigned* at a point in the program if **every** possible execution path from its declaration to that
point includes an assignment to it. This is the same analysis as performed by Java, C#, and Kotlin compilers.

### Local variables

A local variable declared without an initializer is in an *unassigned* state. The compiler **must reject** any read
of a local variable that is not definitely assigned at the point of the read.

Control-flow constructs affect assignment status:

| Construct | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| `if/else` | The variable is definitely assigned after the `if/else` only if it is assigned in **both** branches. An `if` without `else` does not contribute. |
| `while` | The body may execute zero times, so assignments inside `while` do not make the variable definitely assigned after the loop. |
| `for` | Same as `while` for the loop body. The initializer (`init` part) contributes normally. |
| `try/catch/finally` | The variable is definitely assigned after the `try/catch` only if it is assigned in the `try` block **and** in every `catch` block. Assignments in `finally` always contribute. |
| `switch/match` | The variable is definitely assigned after the `switch` only if **every** `case` (including `default`) assigns it, and the switch is exhaustive. |

**Error:** `E001 — Variable '%s' may not have been initialized`

See: [specs.md § Definite assignment](specs.md#null-initialization-and-default-values)

### Class properties

Class properties follow different rules depending on their type:

| Property type | Rule |
|---------------|------|
| Scalar (`int`, `float`, `bool`, `byte`) | Automatically initialized to default value (`0`, `0.0`, `false`, `0`). No check needed. |
| `string` | Automatically initialized to `""`. No check needed. |
| Nullable reference (`T\|null`) | Automatically initialized to `null`. No check needed. |
| Non-nullable reference (`T` where T is a class) | **Must** be assigned at declaration site or in **every** path of every `construct` overload. |

For non-nullable reference properties, the compiler must analyze all constructor bodies and verify that every code
path through the constructor assigns the property. If any path exits the constructor without assigning the property,
the compiler must reject the code.

**Error:** `E002 — Property '%s' of non-nullable type '%s' is not initialized in constructor`

---

## Null safety

### Assignment to non-nullable types

The compiler **must reject** any assignment of `null` to a variable whose declared type does not include `null` in a
union. This applies to local variables, parameters, properties, and return values.

```
string name = null;           // E003
string|null name = null;      // OK
```

**Error:** `E003 — Cannot assign 'null' to type '%s' (type does not include null)`

### Union type compatibility

When assigning a value to a union type, the compiler verifies that the value's static type is one of the union's
constituent types (or a subclass thereof). Conversely, using a union-typed value in a context that expects a specific
type requires narrowing (e.g. via an `if` check, `match`, or null comparison).

```
string|int value = 42;       // OK — int is in the union
string|int value = true;     // E004 — bool is not in the union
```

**Error:** `E004 — Type '%s' is not assignable to '%s'`

---

## Type checking

### Auto type deduction

When a variable is declared with `auto`, the compiler deduces the type from the initializer expression. The deduced
type is fixed at compile-time and the variable behaves as if it were declared with that explicit type.

Rules:
- `auto` **requires** an initializer. A declaration `auto x;` without assignment is a compile-time error.
- The deduced type is the static type of the initializer expression.
- `auto` is valid for local variables, loop variables (`for (auto item : collection)` or `for (const auto item : collection)`; see [specs.md § Loops](specs.md#loops)), and variable declarations with `new`, function calls, or expressions.

**Error:** `E005 — Cannot use 'auto' without an initializer`

### Template instantiation

Templates are instantiated at compile-time. When a template class or method is used with concrete type arguments,
the compiler generates a specialized version with those types substituted and then type-checks the resulting code.

The compiler must verify:
- All operations used on the type parameter are valid for the concrete type (e.g. `a > b` requires that the type
  supports `operator>`).
- **Bounded type parameters:** When a type parameter is declared with `extends Bound` (see [specs.md § Bounded type parameters](specs.md#bounded-type-parameters)), the concrete type argument must be a subtype of the bound (implement the interface or extend the class). This is checked at instantiation time, before structural verification.
- **Unbounded parameters:** When no bound is specified, template arguments are checked structurally: all operations used on the type parameter must be valid for the concrete type.

**Error:** `E006 — Type '%s' does not support operator '%s' (required by template '%s')`  
**Error:** `E037 — Type '%s' does not satisfy bound '%s' (required by template '%s')`

### Cast validation

Cast rules are defined in the language specification: [Type conversions and casting](specs.md#type-conversions-and-casting). The cast operator `(T) expr` is validated at compile-time. The compiler accepts a cast when:

| Source → Target | Rule |
|-----------------|------|
| Primitive → same primitive | Identity, always valid. |
| Numeric widening (`byte` → `int`, `int` → `float`) | Implicit, no cast needed. |
| Numeric narrowing (`float` → `int`, `int` → `byte`) | Explicit cast required, valid. |
| Any → `string` | Valid if source is a primitive or implements `Stringable`. Otherwise compile-time error. |
| Class → superclass | Always valid (upcast). |
| Superclass → subclass | Valid at compile-time, checked at runtime (throws `InvalidCastException` on failure). |
| Unrelated class → class | Compile-time error. |
| `T|null` → `T` | Not allowed (reducing nullability by cast alone). |

**Error:** `E007 — Cannot cast '%s' to '%s'`

### String concatenation

The `+` operator performs string concatenation when at least one operand is `string`. The compiler must verify that
the non-string operand is either:
- A primitive type (`int`, `float`, `bool`, `byte`) — implicit conversion to string.
- A reference type that implements `Stringable` — calls `toString()`.

Otherwise the expression is a compile-time error.

**Error:** `E008 — Cannot concatenate 'string' with type '%s' (type does not implement Stringable)`

### Operator type compatibility

For every binary operator expression `a op b`, the compiler verifies that:
1. The left operand's type defines `operator op` accepting the right operand's type, **or**
2. Both operands are primitives and the operation is a built-in operator for those types.

For unary operators (`!`, `-`, `++`, `--`), the operand type must be a primitive that supports the operator, or a
class that overloads it.

**Error:** `E009 — Operator '%s' is not defined for types '%s' and '%s'`

---

## Immutability enforcement

### Const methods

A method declared `const` (after the parameter list) cannot modify any property of `this`. Inside a const method,
the compiler must reject:
- Any assignment to `this.property`.
- Any call to a non-const method on `this`.

**Error:** `E010 — Cannot modify property '%s' in a const method`
**Error:** `E011 — Cannot call non-const method '%s' in a const method`

### Const parameters

A parameter declared `const` cannot be reassigned or mutated inside the method body. For object types, only
`const` methods may be called on the parameter.

**Error:** `E012 — Cannot modify const parameter '%s'`

### For-each loop in const context

When a for-each loop iterates over a collection that is read-only in the current scope, the loop variable is implicitly non-modifiable (see [specs.md § Loops](specs.md#loops)). This applies when:

1. The loop is inside a **const method** and the collection is a property of `this` (e.g. `for (auto item : this.items)`).
2. The collection is a **const parameter** or **const ref parameter** (e.g. `void f(const int[] arr) { for (auto x : arr) { ... } }`).

In these cases, the compiler must reject any assignment to the loop variable and any call to a non-const method on it.

**Error:** `E039 — Cannot modify loop variable '%s' — implicitly const when iterating over read-only collection`

### Readonly classes and properties

- A `readonly` **class**: after construction, **no** property of any instance can be modified. The compiler must
  reject any assignment to a property outside of `construct`.
- A `readonly` **property**: only that specific property is immutable after construction.

In both cases, assignment is allowed inside `construct` (including via `this.property = ...`).

**Error:** `E013 — Cannot modify property '%s' of readonly class '%s'`
**Error:** `E014 — Cannot modify readonly property '%s'`

---

## Exception checking

### Checked exception propagation

The compiler enforces that every checked exception (any exception that is not a subclass of `RuntimeException`) is
either:
1. Caught in a surrounding `try/catch` block with a compatible catch clause, **or**
2. Declared in the enclosing method's `throws` clause.

This applies to:
- Direct `throw` statements.
- Calls to methods that declare `throws`.
- Constructor calls (`new`) when the constructor declares `throws`.

Runtime exceptions (`RuntimeException` and subclasses) are exempt: they do not require `throws` declarations and
can propagate freely.

**Error:** `E015 — Unhandled checked exception '%s' — must be caught or declared in 'throws'`

### Exception inheritance rules

When a method overrides a parent method, the overriding method's `throws` clause must **cover** every checked
exception declared by the parent. Specifically:
- For each exception type `E` in the parent's `throws` clause, the child's `throws` clause must include `E` or a
  subclass of `E`.
- The child may not introduce new checked exception types that are not subtypes of exceptions declared by the parent.

**Error:** `E016 — Overriding method does not declare exception '%s' from parent method`
**Error:** `E017 — Overriding method declares exception '%s' not thrown by parent method`

---

## Visibility enforcement

The compiler enforces access rules based on visibility modifiers:

| Modifier | Accessible from |
|----------|----------------|
| `public` | Anywhere. |
| `protected` | The declaring class and its subclasses. |
| `private` | The declaring class only. |

Every class member (properties, methods, constructors, destructors) **must** have an explicit visibility modifier.
Omitting it is a compile-time error.

**Error:** `E018 — Member '%s' is not accessible from '%s' (visibility: %s)`
**Error:** `E019 — Missing visibility modifier on member '%s'`

---

## Inheritance modifiers (abstract, final)

The compiler enforces the rules for `abstract` and `final` as defined in [specs.md § Abstract classes and methods](specs.md#abstract-classes-and-methods) and [specs.md § Final classes and methods](specs.md#final-classes-and-methods).

### Abstract classes and methods

- An abstract class cannot be instantiated with `new`.
- A class that declares or inherits an abstract method without implementing it must be declared `abstract`.
- An abstract method has no body (ends with `;`).

**Error:** `E032 — Cannot instantiate abstract class '%s'`
**Error:** `E033 — Class '%s' must be declared abstract (has unimplemented abstract method '%s')`
**Error:** `E034 — Abstract method '%s' cannot have a body`

### Final classes and methods

- A final class cannot be extended.
- A final method cannot be overridden.

**Error:** `E035 — Cannot extend final class '%s'`
**Error:** `E036 — Cannot override final method '%s'`

---

## Parameter validation

### Ref parameter rules

When a parameter is declared `ref`, the compiler must verify:
- The caller uses the `ref` keyword at the call site.
- The argument is a writable variable (not a literal, expression result, or const variable).
- Optional parameters cannot be `ref`.

When a parameter is declared `const ref`, the argument must still be a variable (to bind the reference), but the
method body cannot modify it.

**Error:** `E020 — Argument for 'ref' parameter '%s' must be a variable`
**Error:** `E021 — Missing 'ref' keyword at call site for parameter '%s'`
**Error:** `E022 — Optional parameters cannot be declared 'ref'`

### Named and optional parameter rules

The compiler validates call sites with named parameters:
- All required parameters (those without default values) must be provided, either positionally or by name.
- Positional arguments must precede all named arguments.
- A parameter cannot be provided both positionally and by name.
- Default values for optional parameters must be compile-time constants.

**Error:** `E023 — Required parameter '%s' not provided`
**Error:** `E024 — Positional argument after named argument`
**Error:** `E025 — Parameter '%s' provided both positionally and by name`
**Error:** `E026 — Default value for parameter '%s' must be a compile-time constant`

---

## Entry point validation

The compiler verifies that the program contains exactly one `main` method with the signature:

```
public static int main(string[] args)
```

- The method must be `public static`.
- The return type must be `int`.
- The parameter list must be `(string[])`.
- Exactly **one** such method must exist across the entire program. Zero or more than one is an error.
- This requirement does not apply to library projects (no entry point needed).

**Error:** `E027 — No 'main' method found`
**Error:** `E028 — Multiple 'main' methods found`
**Error:** `E029 — 'main' method has incorrect signature (expected: public static int main(string[]))`

---

## Warnings

### Nodiscard

When a method or function is marked `nodiscard`, calling it and discarding the return value produces a
**warning** (not an error). The compiler should emit a diagnostic but not reject the program.

**Warning:** `W001 — Return value of nodiscard method '%s' is discarded`

---

## Reserved keywords

The following identifiers are reserved and cannot be used as variable names, method names, class names, or any other
identifier:

- All keywords listed in [specs.md § Keywords](specs.md#keywords).
- `undefined` — reserved keyword that does not participate in the type system.

**Error:** `E030 — '%s' is a reserved keyword and cannot be used as an identifier`

---

## Default values

The compiler applies default values in two contexts:

### Array creation with fixed size

`new T[n]` creates an array of `n` elements, each initialized to the default value for type `T`:

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| `int`, `byte` | `0` |
| `float` | `0.0` |
| `bool` | `false` |
| `string` | `""` |
| Reference type (`T\|null`) | `null` |
| Non-nullable reference type | **Not allowed** — `new T[n]` where `T` is a non-nullable reference type is a compile-time error (there is no valid default). |

**Error:** `E031 — Cannot create array of non-nullable type '%s' with fixed size (no default value)`

### Multidimensional array creation

`new T[n₁][n₂]…[nₖ]` is syntactic sugar. The compiler desugars it into nested allocations:

1. Evaluate all dimension expressions `n₁, n₂, …, nₖ` left-to-right and store in temporaries.
2. Emit `NEW_ARRAY` for the outermost array (element type = `T[]…[]` with k−1 brackets, size = `n₁`).
3. For each index `i` in `[0, n₁)`, emit a loop that allocates the next-level array (`NEW_ARRAY` with element type = `T[]…[]` with k−2 brackets, size = `n₂`) and stores it with `ARRAY_STORE`. Repeat recursively for each remaining dimension.

**Partial dimensions** (`new T[n₁][]`): the compiler only allocates the outermost array; inner elements are `null`. The element type of the outer array is the inner array type as nullable (e.g. `int[]|null`).

Dimension sizes may only be omitted as a **contiguous suffix** from the right: `new int[3][][]` is valid, `new int[][3][]` is not.

**Error:** `E038 — Non-first dimension size omitted in middle position in '%s'`

`E031` still applies at each level: `new MyClass[n]` is rejected if `MyClass` is non-nullable and has no default value.

### Class property defaults

Properties declared without an initializer receive the default value for their type (same table as above).
Non-nullable reference properties have no default and must be initialized — see
[Definite assignment § Class properties](#class-properties).

## Optimizations

The compiler **may** apply optional optimizations such as constant folding, dead code elimination, devirtualization,
inlining, and incremental compilation. All optimizations must preserve observable semantics. See [optimizations.md](optimizations.md) for the
full optimization contract (compiler and VM).

---

## Compiler invocation (nlc)

The compiler is invoked as:

    nlc [options] <sources...>

### Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `<sources...>` | One or more NL source files (`.nl`). Each file is compiled to one module (see [vm.md § Module format](vm.md#module-format)). Order may matter for entry/module resolution; the first file or a designated entry is used as the program entry when producing an executable bundle. |

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-o <dir>`, `--output <dir>` | Output directory for emitted modules (`.nlm`). Default: current directory or implementation-defined. |
| `--entry <path>` | *(Optional)* Path of the source file that contains the program entry point (`main`). If omitted, the implementation may use the first file or require exactly one module with `main`. |
| `-c` | Compile only; emit modules and do not link or produce a runnable bundle. |
| `--version` | Print compiler version and exit. |
| `-h`, `--help` | Print usage and exit. |
| `-Werror` | Treat all warnings as errors. |
| `-v`, `--verbose` | Verbose diagnostics (implementation-defined). |
| `--incremental`, `-i` | *(Optional)* Enable incremental compilation. Cache compiled modules and recompile only changed files and their dependents. See [optimizations.md § Compiler optimizations](optimizations.md#compiler-optimizations). |

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success; all sources compiled. |
| Non-zero | Compilation failed (syntax error, semantic error per [Error code summary](#error-code-summary), or I/O error). |

### Conventions

- Source paths follow the one-class-per-file convention; directory structure reflects namespace (see [specs.md § Source code files](specs.md#source-code-files)).
- Output module names or paths are derived from the fully qualified class name (e.g. `com.example.App` → `com/example/App.nlm` or implementation-defined).
